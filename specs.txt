Spec_1
Behavior: counts the repeats of a single letter, not in a full sentence context
Why: single character input will be easiest to handle
Input 1: "a"
Input 2: "a"
Output:  1

Spec_2
Behavior: counts the repeat of a two letter word, not in the context of a sentence
Why: adding a second character will be slightly harder than one character, should scale up to words of any character length
Input 1: "it"
Input 2: "it"
Output: 1

Spec_3
Behavior: counts the repeat of a single letter, in the context of a sentence
why: may have to add a new method to break apart a sentece
Input 1: "a dog ate the biscuit"
Input 2: "a"
Output: 1

Spec_4
Behavior: counts the repeat of a three letter word in the context of a sentence
why: should follow from 3, but want to make sure nothing breaks when adding complexity
Input 1: "a dog ate a biscuit"
Input 2: "ate"
Output: 1

Spec_5
Behavior: counts the repeat of a word multiple times
why: may have to add new math to count words multiple times
Input 1: "when she went to the bar, she had a great time"
Input 2: "she"
Output: 2
